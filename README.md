## The What
Sylo is a life organising app that allows you to create one or more lists at any given time and add items to them. From there you can delete those items as you complete them and then delete whole lists when you finish. 

My focus of this project was to create something with solid foundations to display my learnings of how to build a full stack application.

## The tech
* MERN stack app.
* Implemented react context, router and created custom hooks
* Styled with vanilla CSS (very basic at that) to give me a good understanding of how it works
* JWT for authorisation
* Use of controllers in the backend to keep the server file clean
* Fetch for api calls
